Installation procedures
-----------------------

Currently there is no proper Python package. I'll appreticate any help in
creating it, as I'm not experienced in creating them. So, list of depencencies:

* Python v. 2.5, 2.6, 2.7. I think it should also work with 3.*, but i've not tested it.
* PyQt4.
* Numpy.
* lxml.
* appdirs.
* LCMS bindings (v. 1.19 will be OK) - optional, used for LCh and Lab color
  models. They simply will not be available if you have not LCMS bindings
  installed.
* TinyCSS - optional. Used for loading (parsing) CSS files.
* PIL or Pillow - optional. Used for loading raster images as palettes.
* python-colourlovers - optional. Used to download palettes from colorlovers.com.
* scikit-learn - optional, not used by default. Can be used as alternative
  variant for loading raster images as palettes.

On most Linux distributions, you can just run "palette_editor.py" after
installing that depencencies.

For Windows, distribution can be created with PyInstaller and (optionally) NSIS:

* To compile scripts into Windows executable files, run "pyinstaller
  windows\palette_editor.spec" (under Windows or under Wine) This will create a folder
  "dist\palette_editor" with set of binary files (palette_editor.exe is the main executable file).
  You can distribute that folder any way you want.
* To create proper installer, run "makensis colors.nsis" (this can be done
  under Linux or Windows). This will create file "dist\palette-editor.exe".
